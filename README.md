Problem Statement Title: Creating a cyber triage tool to streamline digital forensic investigation

Description: To design and develop an innovative digital forensics and incident response tool with an intuitive and accessible interface for investigators, that streamlines the process of importing evidence, conducting automated analysis, and generating detailed reports. The tool should feature an interface with clear navigation & real-time data visualization and should support: 1. Automated data collection from RAW images (forensic images) and other formats using disk imaging tools 2. Automate the scanning and analysis of data, including files, system logs, registry entries, network activity etc. 3. Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) and related suspicious activities 4. Integrate AI/ML algorithms for anomaly detection and pattern recognition. The AI/ML feature should incorporate a scoring system and recommendation engine that allow investigators to quickly focus on the important artifacts. 5. User-friendly review options should include interactive timelines and graphical summaries, while comprehensive reporting capabilities should allow exports in various formats such as PDF, JSON, and CSV.
